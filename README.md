# Git-101-Project - New version

Hello Kalob, this is my line on local computer. I will push this to the GitHum in a minute (I hope) :-)
Hello again Kalob. So my local update was successful as you can see.
This line and line above are made on GitHub. I'm going to pull it to local computer now.
Fixing spelling mistakes now. All should be good after pushing it back to GitHub.
